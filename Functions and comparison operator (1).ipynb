    "\n",
    "## What is the operator in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "Python operator is a symbol that performs an operation on one or more operands. An operand is a variable or a value on which we perform the operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What are the 6 comparison operators?\n",
    "\n",
    "Comparison operators — operators that compare values and return true or false . The operators include: > , < , >= , <= , == , and != .\n",

    "## Difference between == and is operator in Python\n",

    "The == operator compares the values of both the operands and checks for value equality. Whereas is operator checks whether both the operands refer to the same object or not. ... We can check it with id() function in python which returns the “identity” of an object."
